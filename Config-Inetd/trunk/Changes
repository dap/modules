Revision history for Perl extension Config::Inetd.

0.27 Sat Nov 10 22:04:05 CET 2007

 - Fixed permissions for 't/data/inetd.conf' by inlining 
   the data and copying it to a temporary file while testing.

 - Undo the bailing out within 'methods.t'.

0.26 Fri Nov  9 22:47:46 CET 2007

 - Bail out within 'methods.t' when no system-wide 
   configuration (i.e. 'inetd.conf') is being found.

0.25 Sun Mar 19 22:49:56 CET 2006

 - Added INSTALL containing install instructions.

0.23 Wed Mar 15 22:51:54 CET 2006

 - Added func.t to the test suite. Checks against a local 
   copy of inetd.conf whether $inetd->dump_enabled() & $inetd->
   dump_disabled() return the expected amount of services.
   Furthermore, evaluates whether $inetd->disable() & $inetd->
   enable() trigger the according changes correctly; the state 
   of $inetd->is_enabled() is checked against an enabled service.
   All services are checked via a custom regular expression to
   ensure that instance data access functions.

0.22 Wed Mar 15 16:51:11 CET 2006

 - Lines read in from inetd.conf preserve their newlines as
   specified via the Tie::File option autochomp.
 
 - Inetd.pm (formerly known as Entity.pm) is warnings-free 
   (previously emitted warnings while splitting the service/protocol 
   from the inetd.conf and for 1 inner reference that existed
   for the tied Tie::File object).
   
 - Suitable Build.PL added.
