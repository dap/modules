NAME
    Config::Inetd - Interface inetd's configuration file

SYNOPSIS
     use Config::Inetd;

     $inetd = Config::Inetd->new;

     if ($inetd->is_enabled(telnet => 'tcp')) {
         $inetd->disable(telnet => 'tcp');
     }

     print $inetd->dump_enabled;
     print $inetd->dump_disabled;

     print $inetd->{CONF}[6];

DESCRIPTION
    "Config::Inetd" is an interface to inetd's configuration file
    inetd.conf; it simplifies checking and setting the enabled/disabled
    state of services and dumping them by their state.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
     $inetd = Config::Inetd->new('/path/to/inetd.conf');

    Omitting the path to inetd.conf, will cause the default /etc/inetd.conf
    to be used.

METHODS
  is_enabled
    Checks whether a service is enlisted as enabled.

     $inetd->is_enabled($service => $protocol);

    Returns 1 if the service is enlisted as enabled, 0 if enlisted as
    disabled, undef if the service does not exist.

  enable
    Enables a service.

     $inetd->enable($service => $protocol);

    Returns 1 if the service has been enabled, 0 if no action has been
    taken.

    It is recommended to preceedingly run "is_enabled()" to determine
    whether a service is disabled.

  disable
    Disables a service.

     $inetd->disable($service => $protocol);

    Returns 1 if the service has been disabled, 0 if no action has been
    taken.

    It is recommended to preceedingly run "is_enabled()" to determine
    whether a service is enabled.

  dump_enabled
    Dumps the enabled services.

     @dump = $inetd->dump_enabled;

    Returns an array that consists of inetd configuration lines which are
    enabled services.

  dump_disabled
    Dumps the disabled services.

     @dump = $inetd->dump_disabled;

    Returns an array that consists of inetd configuration lines which are
    disabled services.

INSTANCE DATA
    The inetd configuration file is tied as instance data (newlines are
    preserved); it may be accessed via "@{$inetd->{CONF}}".
