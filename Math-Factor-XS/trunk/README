NAME
    Math::Factor::XS - Factorise numbers and calculate matching
    multiplications

SYNOPSIS
     use Math::Factor::XS ':all';

     $number = 30107;

     @factors = factors($number);
     @matches = matches($number, @factors);

     print "$factors[1]\n";
     print "$number == $matches[0][0] * $matches[0][1]\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Math::Factor::XS factorises numbers by applying modulo operator
    divisons.

FUNCTIONS
  factors
    Factorises numbers.

     @factors = factors($number);

    $number will be entirely factorised and its factors will be saved within
    the array @factors.

  matches
    Evaluates matching multiplications.

     @matches = matches($number, @factors);

    The factors within @factors will be multplicated against each other and
    results that equal the number itself, will be saved to the
    two-multidimensional array @matches. The matches are accessible through
    the indexes, for example, the first two numbers that matched the number,
    may be accessed by $matches[0][0] and $matches[0][1], the second ones by
    $matches[1][0] and $matches[1][1], and so on.

    If $Math::Factor::XS::Skip_multiple is set to a true value, matching
    multiplications that contain multiplicated (small) factors will be
    dropped.

    Example:

     # accepted 
     30107 == 11 * 2737  

     # dropped
     30107 == 77 * 391

EXPORT
  Functions
