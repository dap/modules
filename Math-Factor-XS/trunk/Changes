Revision history for Perl extension Math::Factor::XS.

0.38  2010-03-26  <schubiger@cpan.org>

 - Merged development version to stable.

0.37_02  2010-03-24  <schubiger@cpan.org>

 - Allow validation of factors to succeed when none are supplied.
   [rt #53739 - Tom Scheper]

 - Return an empty list from xs_matches() if there are no factors.

 - Add a test for no factors provided to matches().

 - Don't force explicit scalar context where an implicit one exists.

0.37_01  2010-03-01  <schubiger@cpan.org>

 - Fix memory leak in xs_factors(). [reported by William P.N. Smith]

0.37 Tue Nov 10 22:37:24 CET 2009

 - Merged development version to stable.

0.36_01 Fri Nov  6 10:17:32 CET 2009

 - Save the quotient as factor only when it's greater than the iterator.
   [rt #50999 - Thor Andreassen]

 - Add a test for even numbers to be factorized.

 - Check the numbers returned deeply against the expected ones.

 - Update broken license links.

0.36 Tue Sep 29 11:36:53 CEST 2009

 - Merged development version to stable.

0.35_02 Tue Sep 15 20:05:35 CEST 2009

 - Check up to square root of a number to determine its factors.
   [rt #46870 - Jonathan Leto]

 - Declare the reference of the factors array which is passed to
   xs_matches() as SV * (instead of AV *). This fixes an error
   when running under perl 5.6.2.

0.35_01 Fri Jun 12 16:35:25 CEST 2009

 - Fix Build.PL related test failures. [rt #39211 - Slaven Rezic]

 - Using the global 'Skip_multiple' does no longer have an effect;
   passing the factors to matches() requires now a list reference.

 - Validation of arguments is handled by Params::Validate.

 - Use printf() instead of formats within the example script.
   This circumvents a segmentation fault reported in [perl #64562].

 - The options hash for the matches() function is being passed to
   the according XSUB as reference.

0.35 Sun Feb  3 14:40:33 CET 2008

 - Reworded documentation.

 - Removed unneeded code within scripts/factors_matches.pl.

 - Renamed the calc_factors.t test-file to the more generic functions.t.

 - Updated ppport.h.

0.34 Tue Aug 14 18:40:38 CEST 2007

 - Beautified documentation (added code tags where suitable).

0.33 Sat Apr  1 16:47:21 CEST 2006

 - Changed Build.PL argument create_makefile_pl from 'passtrough'
   to 'traditional' for the sake of compatibility.

0.30 Fri Nov  4 20:52:13 CET 2005

 - Converted Math::Factor over to XS.

0.29 2005/09/21

 - factors() takes a single number and returns now a flat array
   of factors. matches() likewise. [Ricardo Signes, <rjbs@cpan.org>]

 - Removed each_factor() & each_match() due to data that
   is no longer preserved in multidimensional hash structures
   and therefore doesn't require these accessors.

0.19 2004/01/19

 - Formats are not evaled in loops.

0.17 2004/01/18

 - Matching multiplications that contain smaller factors may
   be skipped.

0.16 2004/01/17

 - factor.pl revisioned.

0.12 2004/01/13

 - Hashes are returned as refs.

0.1 2004/01/12

 - Minor additions.

0.09 2004/01/12

 - Evaluation of ranges implemented.

0.07 2004/01/10

 - show_factor() & show_match() have been moved out of the
   package to bin/factor.pl.

0.05 2004/01/07

 - Iteration over factors and multiplication matches by
   each_factor() & each_match().

0.03 2004/01/06

 - Heredocs mostly replaced with format in show_factor()
   & show_match().

0.02 2004/01/06

 - Documentation covers functionality.

0.01 2004/01/06

 - Initial version.
