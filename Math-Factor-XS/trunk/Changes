Revision history for Perl extension Math::Factor::XS.

0.33 Sat Apr  1 16:47:21 CEST 2006

 - Changed Build.PL argument create_makefile_pl from 'passtrough'
   to 'traditional' for the sake of compatibility.

0.30 Fri Nov  4 20:52:13 CET 2005

0.29 2005/09/21

 - factors() takes a single number and returns now a flat array 
   of factors. matches() likewise. [Ricardo Signes, <rjbs@cpan.org>]
   
 - Removed each_factor() & each_match() due to data that 
   is no longer preserved in multidimensional hash structures 
   and therefore doesn't require these accessors.
