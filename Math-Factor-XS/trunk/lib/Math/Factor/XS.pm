=head1 NAME

Math::Factor::XS - Factorize numbers and calculate matching multiplications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::Factor::XS ':all';
 # or
 use Math::Factor::XS qw(factors matches);

 $number = 30107;

 @factors = factors($number);
 @matches = matches($number, \@factors);

 print "$factors[1]\n";
 print "$number == $matches[0][0] * $matches[0][1]\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Math::Factor::XS> factorizes numbers by applying trial divisions.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 factors

Factorizes numbers.

 @factors = factors($number);

The number will be entirely factorized and its factors will be returned
as a list.

=head2 matches

Calculates matching multiplications.

 @matches = matches($number, \@factors, { skip_multiples => [0|1] });

The factors will be multiplicated against each other and all combinations
that equal the number itself will be returned as a two-dimensional list.
The matches are accessible through the indexes; for example, the first
two numbers that matched the number may be accessed by C<$matches[0][0]>
and C<$matches[0][1]>, the second pair by C<$matches[1][0]> and
C<$matches[1][1]>, and so on.

The hashref provided at the end is optional. If C<skip_multiples>
is set to a true value, then matching multiplications that contain
multiplicated small factors will be discarded. Example:

 11 * 2737 == 30107 # accepted
 77 * 391  == 30107 # discarded

Direct use of C<$Math::Factor::XS::Skip_multiple> does no longer
have an effect as it has been superseded by C<skip_multiples>.

=head1 EXPORT

=head2 Functions

C<factors(), matches()> are exportable.
