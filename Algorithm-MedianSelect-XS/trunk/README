NAME
    Algorithm::MedianSelect::XS - Median finding algorithm

SYNOPSIS
     use Algorithm::MedianSelect::XS qw(median);

     my @numbers = (1,2,3,5,6,7,9,12,14,19,21);

     print median(@numbers);
     print median(\@numbers);

     print median(\@numbers, { algorithm => 'bubble' }); # slow algorithm
     print median(\@numbers, { algorithm => 'quick'  }); # default algorithm

DESCRIPTION
    Algorithm::MedianSelect::XS finds the item which is smaller than half of
    the integers and bigger than half of the integers.

FUNCTIONS
  median
    Takes a list or reference to list of integers and returns the median
    number. Optionally, the algorithm being used for computation may be
    specified within a hash reference. See SYNOPSIS for algorithms currently
    available.

EXPORT
