Revision history for Perl extension Tie::Mounted.

0.18 Tue Feb 26 21:16:18 CET 2008

 - Extended the "gathering-path" code for according
   mount/umount paths.

 - Revised the code for excluding '.' and '..'.

 - Refined the documentation.

0.16 Mon May  1 17:02:19 CEST 2006

 - Extended the _gather_paths() function to croak
   appropriately in case File::Which::which() fails
   to find mount/umount.

0.15 Sun Apr 30 17:38:31 CEST 2006

 - Removed the _locallcall() function, because we don't
   need to guard against mount/umount abuse since local
   file permissions set on them prove to be sufficient.

 - Added the _gather_paths() function which ensures in case
   the predefined variables $MOUNT_BIN & $UMOUNT_BIN
   don't refer to the actual locations that a which()
   lookup is performed.

 - File::Which, IO::File and Symbol are now part of the
   prerequisite set.

 - Improved the documentation to suit the actual state of
   the art.

 - Updated Build.PL to include the author name, the new
   prerequisites, the correct license & the changed
   create_makefile_pl argument.

 - Made the INSTALL file a part of the distribution.

0.08 2004/02/03

   directory, their enlistment in /etc/fstab and according
   state (enabled/disabled).

0.03 2004/01/29

 - Added bogus array option.

0.01 2004/01/29
