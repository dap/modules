Revision history for Perl extension DateTime::Format::Natural.

0.27 Tue Apr 10 22:19:15 CEST 2007

 - Mentioning Tatsuhiko Miyagawa as the inspiration source in
   the documentation's Credits section.

 - Implemented a simple timespan calculation, provided the natural
   dates are separated by the literal token 'to' (case-insensitive).
   [Mark Stosberg <mark@summersault.com>]

0.26 Wed Mar 14 13:15:07 CET 2007

 - The constructor accepts now an optional 'format' parameter specifying
   in which format numeric dates should be parsed (either / or - may be
   used to separate the units). [mike <pulsation@gmail.com>]

0.25 Sun Mar 11 23:02:45 CET 2007

 - Separated the logic within parse_datetime() to _process()
   and according internal subroutines.

 - Commented the majority of functions within Base.pm.

 - Introduced List::MoreUtils' any() & none() functions;
   deprecated use of 'no warnings' statement which need
   arose by accessing indexes of @{$self->{tokens}} where
   no members were present.

 - Created TODO file with pending items.

0.24 Wed Jan 17 22:51:51 CET 2007

 - Introduced a warning handler to silence the warnings about
   undefined values when pattern matching, subtracting and
   performing string comparisons in Natural/Base.pm.

 - Merged the "frontend" scripts to a single one taking
   optionally a language argument indicating the country
   code among other arguments.

 - Made 01-parse_en.t's & 02-parse_de.t's code more readable
   by adding some more separating lines.

 - Moved 'our' declarations in DE.pm & EN.pm towards the top.

0.23 Tue Jan 16 19:51:50 CET 2007

 - The language metadata classes have an AUTOLOAD handler & __new
   constructor automatically exported to their namespaces. Because
   some local fiddling with AUTOLOAD and dynamic variable lookup is
   done, a bunch of symbolic references are created on-the-fly.

0.22 Tue Jan 16 02:58:15 CET 2007

 - Previously four digits were occasionally interpreted as year
   and as well as time based upon context. Disambiguated usage
   as year (applies to all Lang:: classes) and fixed all test
   cases were bogus return values from parse_datetime() have
   been expected in order to have no tests fail.

 - Bound the temporary disablement of strictness for references
   to a tighter scope (applies to all Lang:: classes).

0.21 Tue Nov 28 09:31:20 CET 2006

 - Corrected the classes names provided to use_ok() in 00-load.t.
   [SEKIMURA sekimura@gmail.com]

0.20 Tue Nov 28 01:44:46 CET 2006

 - Optimised the regular expressions used in the AUTOLOAD routine
   in the language classes.

0.19 Mon Nov 27 20:06:17 CET 2006

 - Added to DE.pm & EN.pm an AUTOLOAD handler for each of them.
   The subroutine called prefixed with two underscores will be 
   translated to an according variable name without underscores.
   The parameter to the subroutine will function as variable
   lookup key.

0.18 Sun Nov 26 17:35:17 CET 2006

 - Fixed all occurences of the global weekday hash by adding the
   missing key "{data}" to the variable lookup.

0.17 Sun Nov 26 16:50:14 CET 2006

 - Encapsulated the metadata within the language packages in an
   object which class gets subclassed from Natural.pm.
   [Tatsuhiko Miyagawa <miyagawa@gmail.com>]

0.16 Sat Nov 25 18:09:48 CET 2006

 - Added missing '1;' to the documentation of Authoring.pod.

 - Changed strings in Authoring.pod to be italic.

 - The testsuite now contains a german aquivalent of the english
   parsing test.

0.15 Sam Nov 25 16:49:22 CET 2006

 - Added DateTime::Format::Natural::Lang::Authoring documentation.

0.14 Sat Nov 25 14:34:33 CET 2006

 - Corrected broken package definition.

0.13 Sat Nov 25 04:14:54 CET 2006

 - Separated data from logic by keeping all regular expressions in
   separate packages.

 - Language support for german has been included.

0.12 Fri Nov 24 20:36:37 CET 2006

 - Added some basic tests to the testsuite which exercice
   converting natural format strings to an according datetime object.

 - Enhanced the collection of valid strings that are translated.

0.11 Fri Nov 24 02:15:30 CET 2006

 - Refactored the code where duplicated chunks were available.

 - Evaluated whether the current listed expressions pass the parsing.

0.10 Thu Nov 23 01:14:44 CET 2006

 - Substituted additions/subtractions where possible with the
   appropriate DateTime method calls.

 - An Exception is thrown if no valid input has been given.
   [Tatsuhiko Miyagawa <miyagawa@gmail.com>]

0.09 Sun Nov 19 14:38:24 CET 2006

 - Date strings with slashes are now being split and assigned
   to the appropriate variables.

 - Moved the initialization of object data into a sub.
   Same procedure for the code chunk returning a datetime object.

0.08 Sun Nov 19 12:30:24 CET 2006

 - Code is now object-oriented.

0.07 Sat Oct 28 17:16:53 CEST 2006

 - Replaced all tabs in EN.pm with regular spaces (4).

0.06 Wed Oct 25 20:24:38 CEST 2006

 - Substituted exporting functions with an object-oriented constructor.
   parse_datetime() is now called as a method.
   [Dave Rolsky <urth@autarch.org>]

 - parse_datetime() takes either a datestring or an options hash.
   [Dave Rolsky <urth@autarch.org>]

0.05 Wed Oct 25 11:27:26 CEST 2006

 - Moved from namespace DateTime::Natural::Parse to DateTime::From::Natural::EN
   [Dave Rolsky <urth@autarch.org>]

 - Renamed natural_parse() to parse_datestring().

0.04 Wed Oct 25 00:17:01 CEST 2006

 - Actualized the documentation accordingly.

0.03 Tue Oct 24 01:25:03 CEST 2006
 
 - Appended the i(ncasesensitive) Modifier to a few regular expressions.

 - Fixed the broken newlines for the example documentation.

0.02 Mon Oct 23 23:22:41 CEST 2006

 - DateTime has been added to the dependencies list.
 
 - natural_parse() returns a DateTime object [Clayton L. Scott <clscott@cpan.org>]
 
 - Extended documentation to include some example human readable time strings.

0.01 Sun Oct 22 22:15:54 CEST 2006
