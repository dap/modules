NAME
    LaTeX::Pod - Transform LaTeX source files to POD (Plain old
    documentation)

SYNOPSIS
     use LaTeX::Pod;

     my $parser = LaTeX::Pod->new('/path/to/latex-source');
     print $parser->convert;

DESCRIPTION
    "LaTeX::Pod" converts LaTeX sources to Perl's POD (Plain old
    documentation) format. Currently only a subset of the available LaTeX
    language is suppported - see below for detailed information.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    The constructor requires that the path to the latex source must be
    declared:

     $parser = LaTeX::Pod->new('/path/to/latex-source');

    Returns the parser object.

METHODS
  convert
    There is only one public method available, "convert":

     $parser->convert;

    Returns the POD document as string.

SUPPORTED LANGUAGE SUBSET
    It's not much, but there's more to come:

    * chapters
    * sections/subsections/subsub...
    * verbatim blocks
    * itemized lists
    * plain text
    * bold/italic/code font tags
    * umlauts

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
    The current implementation is a bit *flaky* because "LaTeX::TOM", the
    framework being used for parsing the LaTeX nodes, makes a clear
    distinction between various types of nodes. As example, an \item
    directive has quite often a separate text associated with it as its
    content. Such directives and their expected converted relatives within
    the output stream possibly cannot be easily detected without some kind
    of sophisticated "look-behind" mechanism, which is how "LaTeX::Pod"
    internally functions.

    "LaTeX::Pod" was designed with the intention to be *context-sensitive*
    aware. This is being achieved by setting which node has been seen before
    the current one in order to be able to call the appropriate routine for
    a LaTeX directive with two or more nodes. Furthermore, "LaTeX::Pod"
    registers which node it has previously encountered and unregisters this
    information when it made use of it.

    Considering that the POD documentation format has a limited subset of
    directives, the overhead of keeping track of node occurences appears to
    be bearable. The POD computed may consist of too many newlines before
    undergoing a transformation where leading and trailing newlines will be
    truncated.
