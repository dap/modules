Revision history for Perl extension LaTeX::TOM.

0.7 Tue Aug 28 00:12:03 CEST 2007

 - Added formatting tags to the documentation where appropriate
   and enlisted all methods within the documentation index.

0.6 Wed Mar 14 01:05:09 CET 2007

 - Merged development version to stable.

0.5_05 Sun Feb 18 11:30:51 CET 2007

   occurrences in the LaTeX::TOM::Parser::_applyMapping and
   LaTeX::TOM::Node::getLastChild subroutines.
   [Otakar Smrz, otakar.smrz@mff.cuni.cz]

0.5_04 Fri Feb 16 10:41:21 CET 2007

 - Fixed approximately half a dozen broken hash keys in references
   with {node} instead of {nodes} as subkey.

0.5_03 Fri Feb 16 02:00:52 CET 2007

 - Fixed wrong spelling of $self->{node} to $self->{nodes} within
   LaTeX::TOM::Parser.

0.5_02 Mon Feb 12 03:37:11 CET 2007

 - Added suitable (albeit slightly modified) pod.t & pod-coverage.t
   to the test directory.

 - Documented LaTeX::TOM's constructor new().

0.5_01 Mon Feb  5 08:47:05 CET 2007

 - Resolved accidentally swapped $prev/$next pointers in assignment
   in LaTeX::TOM::Node's listify(), resulting in misbehaviour of
   getNextGroupNode(), getPreviousSibling() and the like.

 - Added fully qualified package declaration to LaTeX::TOM::Parser,
   LaTeX::TOM::Node & LaTeX::TOM::Tree. Removed class specification
   from sub declarations likewise.

 - LaTeX::TOM's constructor, new() reblesses a LaTeX::TOM::Parser
   object with the references to the global variables defined within
   LaTeX::TOM. @_ is passed unaltered to LaTeX::TOM::Parser's new().

 - LaTeX::TOM establishes an ISA relationship with LaTeX::TOM::Parser
   and LaTeX::TOM::Parser with LaTeX::TOM::Node/LaTeX::TOM::Tree.

 - LaTeX::TOM::Tree's constructor, new() now returns a blessed hash
   reference instead of previously a blessed array reference, because
   we're basically reblessing the $parser object.

 - Extracted the TODO part from LaTeX::TOM and put it in a separate
   file named TODO in the root of the distribution.

0.5 Son Dec 31 01:47:36 CET 2006

 - Percents (%) and braces ({}) within verbatim blocks
   are now taken care of while parsing.
