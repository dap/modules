NAME
    Tie::DiskUsage - Tie disk usage to a hash

SYNOPSIS
     use Tie::DiskUsage;

     tie %usage, 'Tie::DiskUsage', '/var', '-h';
     print $usage{'/var/log'};
     untie %usage;

DESCRIPTION
    `Tie::DiskUsage' ties the disk usage, which is extracted from the output
    of `du(1)', to a hash. If the path to perform the `du' command on is
    `undef', the current working directory will be examined; options to `du'
    may be passed at the end of the `tie' invocation with a string provided
    per option.

    By default, the location of the `du' command is assumed to be at
    /usr/bin/du; if `du' cannot be found there, `File::Which' will attempt
    to gather its real location.

    The default path to `du' may be overridden by setting the global
    `$Tie::DiskUsage::DU_BIN' (usually not needed due to `File::Which''s
    automatic search for `du').

BUGS & CAVEATS
    Processing output of `du(1)' requires that each output line is ended by
    a newline.
