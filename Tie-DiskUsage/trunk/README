NAME
    Tie::DiskUsage - Tie disk-usage to a hash

SYNOPSIS
     use Tie::DiskUsage;

     tie %usage, 'Tie::DiskUsage', '/var', '-h';
     print $usage{'/var/log'};
     untie %usage;

DESCRIPTION
    Tie::DiskUsage ties the disk-usage, which is gathered from the output of
    "du", to a hash. If the path to perform the du-command on is being
    omitted, the current working directory will be examined; optional
    arguments to "du" may be passed subsequently.

    By default, the location of the du-command is to be assumed in
    /usr/bin/du; if "du" cannot be found to exist there, "File::Which" will
    attempt to gather its former location.

    The default path to "du" may be overriden by setting
    $Tie::DiskUsage::$DU_BIN.
