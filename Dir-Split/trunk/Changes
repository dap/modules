Revision history for Perl extension Dir::Split.

0.80 Sat Feb 16 13:18:05 CET 2008

 - Added test-file split.t.

 - Revised the code for excluding '.' and '..'.

 - Removed dependency upon a certain perl version.

 - Reformatted scripts/dir-split.pl.

0.79 Thu Dec 20 21:30:14 CET 2007

 - Fixed a bug (don't remove the first two files from the list,
   assuming we have '.' and '..', use grep instead).

0.77 Sun Mar 19 22:14:55 CET 2006

 - Both internal routines which are crucial to moving files,
   _mov_num() and _mov_char(), detect now whether multiple files
   with the same filename exist; if so, "duplicates" are attached
   a numeric suffix which starts at 1 and is subsequently auto-
   incremented.

 - Added INSTALL containing install instructions.
