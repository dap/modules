NAME
    App::OpenVZ::BCWatch - Monitor the OpenVZ user_beancounters file

SYNOPSIS
     use App::OpenVZ::BCWatch;

     $watch = App::OpenVZ::BCWatch->new;
     $watch->process;

DESCRIPTION
    `App::OpenVZ::BCWatch' monitors the /proc/user_beancounters file and
    sends mail notifications whenever important values change (as defined by
    the user).

    The recommended usage of this application module is to use the provided
    vzwatchd daemon.

    Version 2.5 of the user_beancounters file is supported.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new

     $watch = App::OpenVZ::BCWatch->new;

    Instantiate an `App::OpenVZ::BCWatch' object.

METHODS
  process

     $watch->process;

    Inspect whether the user_beancounters file differs from the last run,
    and if, report the differences via mail.

DAEMON USAGE
    Run vzwatchd as root without arguments to obtain a list of commands.

CONFIGURATION FILE
    When vzwatchd is *started* initially, the /etc/vzwatchd.conf file will
    be generated. The configuration will then subsequently remain inactive
    until the `_active' flag is either set within or deleted from the
    configuration file.

  Syntax

    The configuration file is being parsed by Config::File. Unless noted
    otherwise, each option takes exactly one value. Specifying more than one
    value for an option requires that the values are separated by
    whitespace.

  Options

    Adjustable options with defaults are:

    * `mail[from]'
        Mail sender address. Defaults to `root@localhost'.

    * `mail[to]'
        Mail recipient address. Defaults to `root@localhost'.

    * `mail[subject]'
        Mail subject line. Defaults to: `vzwatchd: NOTICE'.

    * `monitor_fields'
        One or more field names to monitor for changes. Defaults to:
        `failcnt'.

    * `sleep'
        Sleep interval in seconds. Defaults to 60.

    * `verbose'
        Be verbose? Defaults to false.

    * `_active'
        Configuration active? Defaults to false.

    Additional options with defaults are:

    * `input_file'
        Location of the user_beancounters file. Defaults to
        /proc/user_beancounters.

    * `data_file'
        Location of the data file. Defaults to $HOME/vzwatchd.dat.

CURRENT LIMITATIONS
    * Cannot parse anything else than the user_beancounters file.
    * Only version 2.5 of the user_beancounters file is known to work.
    * Fixed mail report template.
    * No more than one mail recipient.
