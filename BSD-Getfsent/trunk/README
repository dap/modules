NAME
    BSD::Getfsent - Get file system descriptor file entry

SYNOPSIS
     use BSD::Getfsent qw(getfsent);

     while (@entry = getfsent()) {
        print "@entry\n";
     }

FUNCTIONS
  getfsent
    In list context, each file system entry is returned ("getfsent()"
    continuously reads the next line of the /etc/fstab file).

    The list returned is structured as follows:

     $entry[0]    # block special device name
     $entry[1]    # file system path prefix
     $entry[2]    # type of file system
     $entry[3]    # comma separated mount options
     $entry[4]    # rw, ro, sw, or xx
     $entry[5]    # dump frequency, in days
     $entry[6]    # pass number on parallel fsck

    In scalar context, total of entries is returned.

FILES
    /etc/fstab

EXPORT
    "getfsent()" is exportable.

BUGS & CAVEATS
    "BSD::Getfsent" was, as it name suggests, developed for BSD-like
    systems. It may be nevertheless suitable for other UNIX-like systems,
    including Linux, but remains untested. Bear in mind, that tests will
    fail if no /etc/fstab can be found (in order that testing on systems
    like Windows, where no /etc/fstab exists, doesn't result in a false
    positive).
