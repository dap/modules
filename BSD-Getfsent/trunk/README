DESCRIPTION

    "getfsent()" then continuously reads the next line of the /etc/fstab
    file, opening the file if necessary.

     $entry[0]    # block special device name 
     $entry[1]    # file system path prefix
     $entry[2]    # type of file system
     $entry[3]    # comma separated mount options
     $entry[4]    # rw, ro, sw, or xx
     $entry[5]    # dump frequency, in days 
     $entry[6]    # pass number on parallel fsck

    In scalar context, total of entries is returned.

FILES
    /etc/fstab
