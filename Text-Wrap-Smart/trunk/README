NAME
    Text::Wrap::Smart - Wrap text into chunks of equal length

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::Wrap::Smart qw(wrap_smart);

     $text = .. # random content & length
 
     %options = (
                 no_split => 1,
                 max_msg_size => 160,
                );

     @chunks = wrap_smart($text, \%options);

DESCRIPTION
    "Text::Wrap::Smart" was primarly developed to split an overly long SMS
    message into chunks of equal size. The distribution's "wrap_smart()" may
    nevertheless be used for other purposes.

FUNCTIONS
  wrap_smart
     @chunks = wrap_smart($text [, { options } ]);

    "options" may contain the "no_split" option indicating that words shall
    not be broken up. "max_msg_size" sets the character length boundary for
    each chunk emitted.
